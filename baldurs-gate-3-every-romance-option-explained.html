Whether it’s upgrades and different fighting skill trees, doing quests that affect the larger world of the game, or even getting into an intimate relationship with your party members, Baldur’s Gate 3 has got it all.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=169 data-injectable=false>In fact, you can romance <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">almost every companion in this game</a>, but the initiation of that connection isn’t as straightforward as in many other games of this genre.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Here you’ll see a list of every romanceable option in Baldur’s Gate 3, and what you can do to give yourself a headstart.</p><h2 id=h-how-does-romance-work-in-baldur-s-gate-3 data-injectable=false>How does romance work in Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Baldurs-gate-III-elf-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Baldurs-gate-III-elf-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Baldurs-gate-III-elf-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Baldurs-gate-III-dwarf-1.jpg><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>While you can indeed select a person from your pool of companions (Gale, Lae’zel, Wyll, Jaheira, etc.) to initiate a romance, the road to actualizing that relationship will be long and complicated. It’s important to recognize the defining traits of the character you want to get into a relationship with because their opinion of you determines if they’ll be receptive to that attention or not.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>For starters, you have to make a positive impression. If one of your companions favors peaceful solutions to conflicts and confrontations, then ending the ones that come your way in a similar fashion will gain their approval. Doing side quests that involve those companions and their personal dilemmas will also help you on that path.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>The best way to develop your relationship with companions is by chatting them up at the Camp. There’s also a page in the codex that explains what you know about each of them. Larian has confirmed that players can romance other NPCs as well, but don’t expect that pathway to have the same level of depth as the companions.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>The best thing about romance in Baldur’s Gate 3 is that it’s not limited by gender, race, or sexuality, giving you a true taste of role-playing freedom in video game romance.</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Now, let’s get into the list of characters you can actually romance in Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Romanceable characters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/baldurs-gate-3-dialogue-tree.jpg><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>At the moment, here are all the characters you can definitely romance in the game. (Larian might expand this list with further expansions or DLCs down the road. There are already several characters that should’ve been romanceable, so it might have to do <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with all the content the studio had to cut</a> in order to finish the game on time.)</p><ul data-current-count=601.5 data-injectable=true><li>Astarion</li><li>Gale</li><li>Lae’zel</li><li>Shadowheart</li><li>Wyll</li><li>Karlach</li><li>Minthara</li><li>Halsin</li></ul><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>While we’d be getting into spoiler territory if we explained the starting point and continuation of every romance, we’re going to give you some general pointers for how to approach every character on this list, starting with the enigmatic and callous Astarion.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Astarion romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/astarion-bg3.jpg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Astarion is a bit of a narcissist who sees himself as higher than everybody else. If you want to get his attention (or approval) you need to be cruel to other people and uncaring toward their problems. Try to channel your clever and deceptive side and you’ll find yourself in bed with Astarion. Literally, in this case.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>In the Forgotten Realms canon, Astarion can be categorized as a vampire spawn (fifth edition) who has lived for centuries. The High Elf rogue served a sadistic master for years but might decide to redeem himself if the player chooses to play as him. And if he’s a companion, well, who knows what could happen then.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Gale romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/gale.jpg><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Gale is one of the most interesting characters in the Baldur’s Gate 3 ensemble. A powerful wizard with great ambitions, Gale tried to become the greatest sorcerer the world has ever seen, but that ended in disaster for him. Now, he carries a Netherese Destruction Orb inside his chest, which might level an entire city with its explosion if and when it happens.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>The character has the heart of a poet, so if you wish to gain his approval, you must show a keenness for sorcery as well as delve into intellectual matters and the arts. And try to avoid violence in his presence as much as you can. Gale can be added to your companions list right after the game’s prologue.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Lae’zel romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/laezel-bg3.jpg><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>Lae’zel is a very tough nut to crack in terms of romance. She’s not really sentimental or sympathetic, so it’s difficult to win her over by your actions alone. One thing you can use to your advantage, however, is the character’s enmity toward another companion – Shadowheart. In terms of characterization and class, Lae’zel is a very ferocious fighter and a great addition to your team even if you fail to romance her.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Shadowheart romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shadowheart-bg3.jpg><p data-characters=550 data-current-count=850 data-injectable=true>Shadowheart is a very strange character study. The game teases the fact that she has a long-buried secret tucked away behind that sweet exterior, so many players might want to tread with caution there. If not, you can simply exploit her rivalry with Lae’zel to gain her approval. Shadowheart also approves of peaceful solutions, so, avoid conflict in confrontations. Think Miranda and Jack in Mass Effect 2 — but this time in a fantasy setting — and you’ll have the gist of what’s going on between Shadowheart and Lae’zel.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Wyll romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/wyll-bg3.jpg><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>Wyll is a human warlock bound by honor and nobility. He might have done something in the past that he’s not strictly proud of, but if you intend to gain his approval and lock in his romance, you need to be as heroic and selfless as possible. And never side with demons or goblins, because it will dissuade the character from getting romantically entangled with you.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Karlach romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/karlacch-baldurs-gate-3.jpg><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>Karlach is a warrior Tiefling belonging to the Barbarian class. She was once a slave and fought in the blood wars of the nine hells, but now that she’s free she wants to exact revenge on those who wronged her. You can find Karlach at the “Risen Road” location and earn her approval by freeing slaves or showing her your strength. Karlach has been an intriguing character up to this point, and we can’t wait to see more of her in the main game.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Minthara romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/minthara-bg3.jpg><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Minthara is a Drow who is looking to assault Druid Grove when you meet her early on in the game. Depending on how you play the game, she can either be an NPC or a boss battle.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>You will have to fight Minthara in most scenarios, but if you decide to work with her, you can slowly gain her approval and even romance her, even if it comes at the cost of your moral compass. Larian has confirmed that Minthara is a companion, but be forewarned; siding with her will cause Wyll to leave your party.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Halsin romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/halsin-bg3.jpg><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>We’re finally here, folks. If you were wondering how you can have sex with a bear in Baldur’s Gate 3, this is the guy you’re looking for. Halsin is a shapeshifting Druid that can turn into a bear. You’ll find him a prisoner in the Worg Pens in Act 1, and when you free him, you can take him on to the goblin camp to eradicate the rest of the Absolute-worshipping creatures. And yes, if you play your cards right and lock in the romance, Halsin will turn into a bear and get intimate with you.</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Back when Baldur’s Gate 3 was still being marketed, people weren’t talking about all the classes and sub-classes you can pick. They weren’t talking about the magic system, the fluid combat, or even all the variables that define each gamer’s playthrough. It was Halsin who generated a lot of debate and hype for fans, mostly due to the utter hilarity of doing it with a man who has turned into a bear. A very conscious, consenting bear, of course.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jaheira romance (Cut content)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jaheira-bg3.jpg><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>Last but not least we come to Jaheira, who is a returning character from previous installments. Jaheira was a companion in Baldur’s Gate I, Baldur’s Gate: Siege of Dragonspear, and Baldur’s Gate II, and she’s continuing that streak through the third installment. Many people assumed that you were going to get to romance Jaheira or even Minsc, but it seems that her romance option was among the content Larian cut from the final release.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>Don’t lose hope, however, as it’s still quite possible to get the opportunity to romance the legendary leader of the Harpers in an update or DLC somewhere down the line.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>Besides all of these choices, there is a string of one-night stands throughout the game, even one involving your enigmatic Guardian. Participating in these will not lock you out of your romance choice. In fact, there is one intimate scene involving two Drows that can lead to a steamy quartet.</p><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=68 data-injectable=false>Baldur’s Gate 3 in its entirety is now available for purchase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZomZqklKq%2FtHnGmqueZWNisrex0bJkq6edlruksYyop62hn6N6psTPpZiippWZfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbaldurs-gate-3-every-romance-option-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbaldurs-gate-3-every-romance-option-explained.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbaldurs-gate-3-every-romance-option-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbaldurs-gate-3-every-romance-option-explained.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbaldurs-gate-3-every-romance-option-explained.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbaldurs-gate-3-every-romance-option-explained.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./peter-ferdinando.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./peter-ferdinando.html>Peter Ferdinando movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./these-are-the-best-gifts-for-lord-of-the-rings-fans.html>These are the best gifts for Lord of the Rings fans</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./these-are-the-best-gifts-for-lord-of-the-rings-fans.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
