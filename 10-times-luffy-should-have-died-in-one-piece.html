Without Chopper the whole prison, including Luffy, would be dead.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Eating a poisoned fish</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>In episode 784, the straw hats arrived at Wano, and Luffy was hungry, leading him to eat the skin of an armored fish.

Akainu’s assault at the paramount war</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>In episode 483, Akainu is outsmarted as the Whitebeard Pirates are fleeing with Luffy and the recently freed Ace. While Akainu deals treacherously with Ace, Luffy follows and joins the attack, also proving unable to defeat him.

Aokiji v Luffy, Zoro and Sanji</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>In episode 228 of One Piece, Aokiji ran into the straw hats and attempted to arrest Nico Robin. He was attacked by a trio of Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji at once, but Nico simply freezes their body parts, rendering them motionless.&nbsp; If Aokiji wanted to kill them, it wouldn’t have cost him too much strength, either, especially as no one strong enough to save them was available at that moment.</p><h2 id=h-1-magellan-s-poison-at-impel-down data-injectable=false>1. Magellan’s poison at Impel Down&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=false>In episode 435, Luffy was on his way to save Ace but had to face the warden at Impel Down where Ace was being held.
