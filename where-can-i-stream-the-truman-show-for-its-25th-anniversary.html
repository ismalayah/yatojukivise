<time>30 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=465 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Few films have had such an intense cultural impact as the Jim Carrey sci-fi satire <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Truman Show</a></strong>. Released in 1998 to critical acclaim (and garnering three well-deserved Oscar nominations), the influential movie has endured over the years and remains a staple of film nerd chat well over two decades later — allegedly, Margot Robbie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">put The Truman Show on her Letterboxd list</a> as a film she watched in preparation for the incredibly hyped upcoming Barbie movie.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Carey is joined by a stellar cast, including Laura Linney, Ed Harris, and Philip Glass, and the result is an absolutely brilliant exploration of the power of media, the importance of privacy, and the human instinct towards voyeurism.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>Now, with 2023 marking the 25th anniversary of the film, there’s renewed interest in the titular Truman and his life. But where can old fans and new, eager viewers have the opportunity to watch the movie? If you want to know where you can stream The Truman Show for its 25th anniversary, then read ahead for our guide.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-truman-show-about data-injectable=false>What is The Truman Show about?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-truman-show.jpg><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>The Truman Show follows the life of Truman Burbank, a child who was the result of an unwanted pregnancy. Instead of aborting him or offering him up for adoption to a family looking for a child, his parents gave him up to a television studio and his life was turned into a reality television show that is filmed 24/7. However, there’s a catch: Truman doesn’t know that he’s in a show.</p><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>Truman lives on a gigantic set that he believes is called Seahaven Island. The island is an idyllic spot, populated by crew members, and full of product placements for both Truman and the eager audience. The show’s producers are able to control every facet of Truman’s life, and have discouraged him from seeking to travel beyond Seahaven through a number of means: pretending his father died in a boating accident and constantly sending him fake magazines that proclaim there’s nowhere on earth better to live than Seahaven are the two biggest.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Truman is married to a woman named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meryl</a>, although when in “college” he fell for an extra named Sylvia (who’s called Lauren outside of Seahaven Island), causing her removal from the show. Despite his marriage, Truman still harbors hopes of reconnecting with her, and believes she lives in Fiji. In reality, Sylvia/Lauren has joined a group of activists dedicated to ending the show and granting Truman his freedom.</p><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>As Truman approaches the age of 30, he begins to notice more and more strange happenings that curtail his desire to stay on Seahaven Island: a spotlight falls to earth, his car radio accidentally picks up a transmission between crew members that’s describing his movements, and he gets a glance of his father, who’s hurried away before Truman can confront him. Truman soon realizes that happenings on the island seems to revolve entirely around him.</p><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>After a number of incidents, including a botched attempt at a road trip, Truman holds Meryl hostage, at which point she breaks character. With Truman’s mental state devolving, the show begins to get record numbers. However, Truman manages to escape and get over the fear of water producers instilled in him with the story about his father, sailing away from the island and eventually hitting a dome that contains Seahaven and the surrounding waters. The producers address him directly, telling him to stay, but he exits through a door instead, where Sylvia and other activists are waiting.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>The Truman Show was immediately praised for its brilliant deconstruction of reality television, and is often seen as prescient with regards to our current social media landscape. Although the premise is hardly believable, great performances, a brilliant script, and a perfect blend of comedy and drama push it from an interesting watch into a genuinely great film.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where can I stream The Truman Show for its 25th anniversary?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Paramount-Logo.jpg><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>If you’re in the U.S., there are two different options to stream The Truman Show for its 25th anniversary.
