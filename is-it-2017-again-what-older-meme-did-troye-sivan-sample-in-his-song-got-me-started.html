<time>22 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=462 data-injectable=true data-video=true>After the success of his dance hit “Rush” earlier this summer, Australian pop singer <strong>Troye Sivan</strong> is seeing a resurgance in popularity. The YouTuber-turned-popstar famously became one of the site’s biggest creators in the early 2010’s, before releasing his first album Blue Neighborhood in 2015. Since then, Sivan has focused on creating music, with his latest song “Got Me Started” already amassing a large amount of listens.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=530 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>But eagle-eared listeners will realize the main beat of the song on the chorus sounds oddly familiar. Sivan teased the sample on social media on September 19, saying “Forgot to mention how hard the sample goes on this one.” If you were on social media in 2017, you definitely recognize the iconic sound of “Shooting Star” by Bag Raiders, which was a meme early on that year featuring people falling through galactic backdrops with the song playing the background. So why is Sivan sampling the song in 2023?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zane Lowe (@zanelowe)</a></p></figure><h2 id=h-aussies-supporting-aussies data-injectable=false>Aussies supporting Aussies</h2><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=701 data-injectable=true>In an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, Troye Sivan mentioned that he is officially the first artist to sample the hit song, and Bag Raiders members Chris Stracey and Jack Glass made it clear that they chose him. “They were like, ‘By the way, we’ve had hundreds of requests and we’ve never said yes. So don’t f*** this up.'” Sivan shared in the interview.</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>According to Sivan, he was already singing the sample while in the studio working on a demo for “Got Me Started.” While he loved the idea of using “Shooting Star,” he assumed since the song had never been sampled before, he would never get permission from Bag Raiders to do it. So while recording a formal version of the song, Sivan texted the A&R (Artists and repertoire) rep for his label EMI Music Australia, asking about getting a sample.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@bag_raiders href=#>@bag_raiders</a><p>First time we’ve ever let anyone use this sample.

According to Sivan, not even 20 minutes after requesting the sample, he received a text with the music track readily available for his use. After the song’s release on September 20, Bag Raiders shared a clip from the music video on TikTok, sharing that they were proud to give the first permission to sample their song to Sivan. “No way we’re doing it for someone we don’t love and respect. Happy release day Troye!!” shared the duo on TikTok.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><h2 id=h-paying-tribute-to-the-meme data-injectable=false>Paying tribute to the meme</h2><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>Considering Troye Sivan has the internet to thank for his career, it’s no surprise he paid tribute to the “Shooting Star” meme in the video for “Got Me Started.” While brief, around the 2:31 minute mark in the video, you see Sivan launch up the side of a building and start flailing as he runs up, something that was a common theme in the edits to the song in 2017.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>For those who may have forgotten about the “Shooting Star” meme, the joke of the meme was someone fell in a weird way, whether off a diving board, a swing, or just tripping on grass. But rather than show them falling and hitting the ground, the freeze-frame of them falling is launched through a variety of green screen backgrounds, most commonly outer space.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Most people credit the trend to YouTube user All Ski Casino, who posted an edit of a larger man diving off a bridge and having him fly through various backdrops. The meme took off in popularity from there, and even got featured in the music video for Katy Perry’s “Swish Swish.” Of course, because it was only in the video and not in the actual song, that doesn’t count as a sample.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BD98872D-6DC3-4B7D-A6A1-9C29BD7CE6D9.jpeg><h2 id=h-meaningful-sampling data-injectable=false>Meaningful sampling</h2><p data-characters=636 data-current-count=936 data-injectable=false>While his sample of “Shooting Star” is historic for Bag Raiders, Troye Sivan said he made sure it was a genuine fit for him during his interview with Apple Music 1. “I think it’s tacky when people sample something, like, out of term. I really, really didn’t want to do that, and I wouldn’t be doing this if that’s what I felt like I was doing.” Sivan shared. Since the usage of the sample came naturally during the production process, Sivan knew to stick to his guns and try for the sample. We’re glad he did, as “Got Me Started” wouldn’t be as iconic without it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46iqmahpGJ%2FcX2WZpigmZmjeri0wK1kqKSUmr9uucSmnGacmZl6tb7Ospxmq5mrrq950pqkqaSVYraveceiqmarn6O0brPOrWSmnV2owaK%2B056baA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-it-2017-again-what-older-meme-did-troye-sivan-sample-in-his-song-got-me-started.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-it-2017-again-what-older-meme-did-troye-sivan-sample-in-his-song-got-me-started.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-it-2017-again-what-older-meme-did-troye-sivan-sample-in-his-song-got-me-started.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-it-2017-again-what-older-meme-did-troye-sivan-sample-in-his-song-got-me-started.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-it-2017-again-what-older-meme-did-troye-sivan-sample-in-his-song-got-me-started.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-it-2017-again-what-older-meme-did-troye-sivan-sample-in-his-song-got-me-started.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./georgia-holt-husband-was-georgia-holt-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./georgia-holt-husband-was-georgia-holt-married.html>Georgia Holt Husband: Was Georgia Holt Married?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./liza-anokhina.html>Liza Anokhina Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./liza-anokhina.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
