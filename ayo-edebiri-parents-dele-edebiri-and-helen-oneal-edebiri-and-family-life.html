Her family raised her in a religious Pentecostal household.</p><p>Talking to Forbes, the young star said, “I grew up very Pentecostal.” She further added that there’s some sort of puritanical self-flagellation that she is very good at doing.</p><p>And while raised very religiously, she was pulled to comedy at a relatively young age. She didn’t think of doing comedy full-time until she moved to New York and realized it could be a career.</p><figure></figure><p>From the beginning, Edebiri always received all the love and support from her family, which helped her a lot in pursuing her dream. After moving to NY, she began preparing to pursue comedy as a college junior.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-father-dele-edebiri></span>Her father Dele Edebiri<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ayo Edebiri father Dele emigrated to the United States from Benin, Nigeria.

In the comment section, she mentioned her father and asked if he liked it. “You two have the exact same smile,” one comment said.</p><p>On June 20, 2021, she uploaded another childhood&nbsp;picture&nbsp;with her dad and said her dad hadn’t responded to her thoughtful test, so she sought gratification elsewhere.</p><p>Dele is also active on social media platforms such as Instagram and&nbsp;Facebook.&nbsp;On&nbsp;Ig, he is found under the username @deleedebiri -he has two posts and 210 followers as of writing.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=mother-helen-oneal-edebiri></span>Mother Helen O’Neal-Edebiri<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ayo Edebiri mother Helen is originally from Barbados.

She further added that she has never made a necklace in her life. In the end, she wrote, “writing is actually very easy!”</p><figure></figure><p>Although The Bear star has no real-life siblings, she does have reel-life siblings, her on-screen sister, Janine, from Abbott Elementary.</p><p>Created by Quinta Brunson, Abbott Elementary is a mockumentary sitcom series starring Brunson as Janine, a second-grade teacher at Abbott Elementary, a poorly funded fictional school in Philadelphia.</p><p>Edebiri’s character,&nbsp;Ayesha, debuted on the show on Valentine’s day-themed episode in February 2023. She joined the second season of the sitcom in a recurring role as Janine’s sister.</p><p>Throughout the show’s run, Janine has occasionally mentioned Ayesha. From what she has shared, the audience knows that the sisters share a bit of a taut relationship and Ayesha lives quite far away.</p><figure></figure><p>In the last episode of March 8 (Teacher Appreciation), Edebiri returned to reprise her role as Ayesha. Ahead of the release of the episode, ABC shared a clip of Brunson and her on-screen sister Edebiri.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-dating-life-and-pregnancy-rumor></span>Her Dating Life And Pregnancy Rumor<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Abbott Elementary star Edebiri appears to be single at the moment.
