Recommended Videos It was a good run. We had some laughs along the way. Distracted by a comic book hero trapped in a Wes Anderson-inspired sci-fi bureaucracy, fans were constantly sideswiped by feelings-charged storytelling, culminating in a finale that totalled our collective emotional Chrysler LeBaron. Against all odds, in a cinematic universe built as a narrative pyramid scheme in which every story has to set up three spin offs before the end of its runtime, Loki simply ends: Quiet, redemptive, with the grace and elegance to make you believe that this was always what this story was building to, even the parts in Thor: The Dark World.</description></item><item><title>Gremlins movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1984)</title><link>/gremlins-1984.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gremlins-1984.html</guid><description>The first half of the movie is the best.
