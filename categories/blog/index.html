But Celestine notices some strange things with the eyes of a newcomer. Birds chirp in the trees, and policemen race over with fire hoses, blasting them to the wind with water.

Mark Amsler, senior English lecturer at the University of Auckland, explains where common words come fromAcronyms (such as "Wof") and initialised abbreviations ("CIA") are nothing new in many languages, especially in corporate, administration or bureaucratic settings.
