Information about the name of the school Bowie Ezio Perego-Saldana currently attends is not public knowledge, but looking at his age, he will still be receiving his elementary education at the moment from a school around their home in Los Angeles.</p><p>Bowie has no personal claim to fame but has remained in the limelight only because of his mother’s celebrity status. He is still concentrating on his education and is yet to choose or start a career for himself. However, considering how successful his parents have been on their individual career paths, it will not be surprising to see the champ growing up to follow in their footsteps and achieve success in his own right.</p><h3><strong>Bowie Ezio Perego-Saldana Has an Identical Twin and One Other Brother</strong></h3><p>The name of Bowie’s twin brother is <span>Cy Aridio </span><span>Saldaña-Perego.

Marco was born on 1st March 1979, making him 44 years old at the moment. This means that his wife, Zoe, is almost a year older than him. Marco was born and raised in Salo, Brescia, Italy, and is the only child of his father, Ezio Perego. He is an Italian-American citizen of white ethnic background.</p><p>Growing up, Marco Perego played soccer and was part of a Venice football club where he played professional football until he was 21 years old. However, he sustained a severe leg injury which forced him to quit the sport to pursue another career. Marco graduated from IULM University in Milan, Italy.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bowie’s father had a passion for art as a child so after he sustained a leg injury, he quickly went back to his childhood interest and today, he is an artist and film producer. Although he became more famous following his marriage to the star actress, Marco Perego first gained prominence after renowned film producer Gilda Moratti purchased one of his art pieces.</p><p>He started his art career in 2002 but it did not pick up quickly until Moratti bought one of his paintings after which his art gradually began to grow noticeably.
