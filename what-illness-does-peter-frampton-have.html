Peter Frampton is a rock musician from the United Kingdom and the United States who has been diagnosed with cancer. Previously, he was a member of the bands Humble Pie and The Herd.</strong></p><p>Peter Kenneth Frampton, better known by his stage name Peter Frampton, is an English and American rock musician, composer, and producer. He’s also recognized for his earlier associations with the bands <a href=#>Humble Pie and The Herd</a>.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.ontrend.news/uploads/2022/5/a341471f-8b24-4b4f-9aa2-db57395bdc53.jpg alt="What Illness Does Peter Frampton Have? Health Problems Explained" width=1024 height=950 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Peter has released numerous solo albums, including Frampton Comes Alive!, his international breakout album, which had multiple hit singles and was certified 8x Platinum in the United States.</p><h2 id=what-illness-does-musician-peter-frampton-have>What Illness Does Musician Peter Frampton Have?</h2><p>After all these years, legendary rock musician Peter Frampton sounds just perfect. This is remarkable because Peter has inclusion body Myositis (IBM), an inflammatory and degenerative muscle disease that causes painless weakening of muscle.</p><p>Frampton, although experienced some weakness and loss of function in larger muscles, his fingers still function great. His finger dexterity was not what his doctor, rheumatologist Lisa Christopher-Stine, expected to find before his first appointment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.ontrend.news/uploads/2022/5/a341471f-8b24-4b4f-9aa2-db57395bdc53.jpg><p>The doctor said she always wondered if Peter would be one of those high-maintenance, dark sunglasses-wearing celebrities. Frampton was not. She added, ” the musician didn’t have an entourage. he is just a very down-to-earth, loving, kind person.”</p><p>The British rock musician is consistently upbeat, with a can-do attitude, a great sense of humor, a kind heart, and a hearty laugh. We can say that Peter has IMB, but IBM does not have him.</p><p>Frampton stated, “Sure, I have my darker moments of life, but I have so much to be thankful for. We all have our own battles. This was meant to be mine, but everybody has something.”</p><h2 id=musician-peter-frampton-health-problems-and-sickness>Musician Peter Frampton Health Problems And Sickness</h2><p>On February 22, 2019, Peter Frampton announced that he would be retiring from touring with his farewell tour, ‘Peter Frampton-The Farewell Tour’ commencing on June 18, 2019, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, running through October 12, concluding in Concord, California.</p><p>The musician also revealed the reason behind the farewell tour, and he was diagnosed with inclusion body myositis (IBM), a progressive muscle disorder. The tour featured special guests Jason Bonham’s Led Zeppelin Evening and Peter’s son.</p><p>Each dollar of every ticket sold for the tour was donated to benefit Peter’s newly formed myositis research fund at Johns Hopkins, where he is being treated. In June 2019, his album, All Blues, featured at number one on the Billboard Top Blues Albums Chart.</p><p>In December 2019, Frampton further announced his farewell U.K. tour to consist of five performances in May 2020. However, the UK/EU was canceled in April due to COVID-19.</p><h2 id=where-is-peter-frampton-now>Where Is Peter Frampton Now?</h2><p>Peter Frampton is doing his best, establishing the Peter Frampton Myositis Research Fund at John Hopkins to raise research on the disease. IBM is pretty rare, merely affecting maybe 8 out of every 1 million Americans.</p><p>IBM has not collected enough research funding, nor has it been a big focus of drug development by pharmaceutical companies. The musician is doing his best to change this situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.ontrend.news/uploads/2022/5/48d65230-c5ee-454e-b09c-082b3ddc97ef.jpg><p>In February 2019, Peter appeared on the hit T.V. show CBS This Morning to announce the fund and his 51-date U.S. farewell tour. He added that each promoter donated a dollar from every ticket bought.</p><p>The musician is best recognized for his hit singles such as “Show Me the Way,” “Do You Feel Like We Do,” “Baby, I Love Your Way,” and “I,m in You,” which remain staples on classic rock radio.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMPHmqtmoZyhu6a%2F0mabqJ2jYr2mwMSrZJ%2BqkaK9tbvNZp%2BarpVk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-illness-does-peter-frampton-have.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-illness-does-peter-frampton-have.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-illness-does-peter-frampton-have.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-illness-does-peter-frampton-have.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-illness-does-peter-frampton-have.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-illness-does-peter-frampton-have.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./luigi-x-bowser-shipping-skyrockets-with-new-super-mario-bros-trailer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./luigi-x-bowser-shipping-skyrockets-with-new-super-mario-bros-trailer.html>Luigi x Bowser shipping skyrockets with new Super Mario Bros. trailer</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./joel-greenberg-was-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison-for-child-trafficking.html>Joel Greenberg Was Sentenced To 11 years In Prison For Child Trafficking</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./joel-greenberg-was-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison-for-child-trafficking.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
