Following these captions, many of their fans are left wondering if the couple is, in fact, a couple or just friends. Another indication that they may be romantically involved is that they sang duets together while in quarantine. A man by the name of Alberto Urso has previously been linked to Benedetta. Singing was a passion for the alleged couples. The 2018 Amici di Maria De Filippi competition was won by Alberto.
